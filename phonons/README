Phonons

1) (optimal) step for pre-convergence of wave functions

- create a supercell in phonopy w/ 'job1' but keep the old unit cell as 'POSCAR-unitcell'
- do not forget to properly change MAGMOM on magnetic structures (check w/ VESTA if necessary)

'INCAR'
-------------------
NSW = 0
LWAVE = .TRUE.
ADDGRID = .TRUE.
(LCHARG = .FALSE.
-------------------


2) main calculation (often really long)

- do some time estimation of this step based on previous calculations, time needed for one iteration and degrees of freedom

'INCAR'
-------------------
ISTART = 1
#NPAR = XXX   parallelization must be TURNED OFF
NSW = 1
IBRION = 6 or 8 (depends whether you want to use 'finite differences' or 'perturbation' method)
#EDIFFG = XXX   forces convergation showed to make some problems so better keep it turned off
-------------------

Specify you k-point path in 'band.conf' file
Specify your temperature interval and q-point mesh in 'mesh.conf' file


After succesfully completing the calculation we can use respective 'job*' where * = 2, 3, 4, 5

OR we can use 'phonon' script which runs EVERYTHING
